I am a technical geek, a fierce engineering leader who believes in order to accomplish the vision, you have to live it.\n\nTo build a long-lasting software system, one must have the drive to first build and trust its teams. Passion drives the teams and the execution of the vision. I have enjoyed my growth being a software engineer, technical lead, and director. My personal and professional experiences have taught me the following about myself:\n\nI can successfully develop and optimize software systems that are highly available, scalable, and fully automated.\n\n- I put the customers' problems at the center of the design strategy.\n- I can execute big ideas with ease and under constraints.\n- I collect adequate data and research to target key problems that can lead to saving time and serving \n   easy and long-lasting solutions.\n\nI can align, lead, grow and build small to large teams.\n\n- Understanding the problem and solving it, comes to me from my gut. However, helping my team \n  understand the problem and getting them through it, is what gives me greater joy.\n- I speak tech and exec.\n- I motivate my people to perform better for the project and for themselves.\n\nI educate, refine and drive myself to be a better person.\n\n- I am constantly learning.\n- I am calm and composed and I know how to work in adversity.\n- I focus on making high-quality decisions that serve the company and the people I associate myself with.\n\nI enjoy meeting new people and hearing new perspectives. Reach out if you want to talk to me about emerging tech, creating software systems, or politics.\n\nProfessional Skills\nData | AI \u0026 ML | Java | C/C++ | Rust | JavaScript | noSQL | Kubernetes | Data Scalability | Automation | Platform Scalability | Data Lake | Cloud Migration | AWS Cloud | Team Building | Mentoring | MLOps | MLFlow | Kotlin | Python | Data Warehouse\n\nDomain Knowledge\nEnterprise Software | Enterprise Architecture | Digital Marketing | Startup Management | Small Business | SaS | IaS | PaS","headline":"Engineering Leader | Sr. Director | Chief Architect | Technical Leader | Engineering Idea To Realization | Visionary","geo":{"country":"United States","city":"San Diego, California","full":"San Diego, California, United States","countryCode":"us"},"languages":[{"name":"English","proficiency":""}],"educations":[{"start":{"year":0,"month":0,"day":0},"end":{"year":0,"month":0,"day":0},"fieldOfStudy":"Computer Software Engineering","degree":"Masters","grade":"","schoolName":"Institute of Management Education Research and Training","description":"","activities":"","url":"","schoolId":"","logo":null},{"start":{"year":0,"month":0,"day":0},"end":{"year":0,"month":0,"day":0},"fieldOfStudy":"Business Administration","degree":"Bachelor","grade":"","schoolName":"Prestige Institute of Management Education and Research","description":"","activities":"","url":"","schoolId":"","logo":null}],"position":[{"companyId":167212,"companyName":"Crunchyroll","companyUsername":"crunchyroll","companyURL":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/crunchyroll/","companyLogo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQHbM0uKsgYryQ/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1721927027597/crunchyroll_logo?e=1749081600\u0026v=beta\u0026t=-6HDci3DcbrDVlmkV_RUUUWsnrKXtROfQrFZ_EVs1M0","companyIndustry":"Entertainment","companyStaffCountRange":"1001 - 5000","title":"Director of Data Engineering","multiLocaleTitle":{"en_US":"Director of Data Engineering"},"multiLocaleCompanyName":{"en_US":"Crunchyroll"},"location":"","description":"Building Data \u0026 AI Organization","employmentType":"Full-time","start":{"year":2024,"month":8,"day":0},"end":{"year":0,"month":0,"day":0}},{"companyId":861115,"companyName":"Saab, Inc.","companyUsername":"saab-inc-us","companyURL":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/saab-inc-us/","companyLogo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQEMmJonhGR_8w/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1630522958761/saab_inc_us_logo?e=1749081600\u0026v=beta\u0026t=M7Mzc22IxFV5a8IFgiQ8_UK-EN0A6jgBEouXd5pcmWY","companyIndustry":"Defense \u0026 Space","companyStaffCountRange":"501 - 1000","title":"Chief Architect \u0026 Engineering Leader","multiLocaleTitle":{"en_US":"Chief Architect \u0026 Engineering Leader"},"multiLocaleCompanyName":{"en_US":"Saab, Inc."},"location":"","description":"• Built Engineering Org.\n• Building Maritime Domain Awareness system - Track vessels in near real time\n• Monitor \u0026 Alert in near real time on illegal or suspicious activities\n• AI/ML \u0026 Pattern Detection++","employmentType":"Full-time","start":{"year":2024,"month":4,"day":0},"end":{"year":2024,"month":7,"day":0}},{"companyId":68353711,"companyName":"Various Startups","companyUsername":"various-startups1","companyURL":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/various-startups1/","companyLogo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQEJXjIEUpuMmg/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1630620461491/various_startups1_logo?e=1749081600\u0026v=beta\u0026t=Q_xKWxOkfDMVzqMM--Lw8hUFOdTdwJY48lT9S58RWAM","companyIndustry":"Computer Software","companyStaffCountRange":"","title":"Engineering and Technical Leader","multiLocaleTitle":{"en_US":"Engineering and Technical Leader"},"multiLocaleCompanyName":{"en_US":"Various Startups"},"location":"United States","description":"• Startups: TalkDesk, CS DISCO, Senslytic, Raddy\n• Organizational Leadership: Spearheaded the creation of the entire organization structure, overseeing hiring processes globally and implementing agile methodologies to enhance project execution efficiency.\n• Strategic Initiatives: Drove initiatives to leverage LLM for future growth, integrated AI Model, Experimentation, MLFLow, Prompt Engineering, Vector Database and more..\n• Strategic Collaboration: Orchestrated collaborative efforts across the organization, successfully driving the execution of multiple high-profile projects.\n• Technical Expertise: Provided architecture guidance for diverse projects, including streaming, applications, scaling, data, and databases, ensuring robust and scalable solutions.\n• Infrastructure Design: Led the design of infrastructure components such as EKS (Kubernetes), CI/CD, Monitoring, Log Processing, Security, ECS, Fargate, and AWS, contributing to seamless operations and heightened system reliability\n• Data Management and AI: Formulated and implemented data modeling strategies, offering expert guidance on database-related matters.
